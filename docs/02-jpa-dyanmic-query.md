# Dynamic Queries in JPA via Spring Boot 3.0

Dynamic queries are essential when our application needs to build queries based on runtime conditions (e.g., user
inputs, filters, etc.). Below are common use cases and solutions for handling dynamic queries in JPA using Spring Boo
3.0.

## Use Case for Dynamic Queries

- **Search Filters**: Building a search screen where users can filter results based on various criteria (e.g., name,
  price, category).
- **Reporting**: Custom reports that aggregate data based on user-selected parameters.
- **Pagination with Filters**: Combining dynamic filtering with pagination for large datasets.

## Core Solutions to Handle Dynamic Queries in Spring Boot JPA

### 2.1 Using `JpaSpecificationExecutor` to execute dynamic queries.

- **When to use**: Ideal for filtering entities based on multiple optional parameters.
- **How it works**: Use `Specifications` to dynamically combine predicates like `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `EQUAL`, etc.

#### Solutions:

- Define a `Speicification` class to handle dynamic conditions.
- Use `JpaSpecificiationExecutor` to execute dynamic queries.

### 2.2 Using `@Query` with Dynamic Parameters

- **When to use**: When query is relatively simple and requires dynamic input (e.g., search terms, filters).
- **How it works**: Use `@Query` with named parameters and build queries dynamically by passing parameters at runtime.

#### Solutions:

- Dynamically build **JPQL** queries using `@Query` and `@Param` for parameters.

### 2.3 Using `Querydsl`

- **When to use**:
- **How it works**: Querydsl allows you to construct dynamic queries using a fluent API. It integrates well with Spring
  Data JPA and provides better readability and maintainability.

#### Solution:

- Use `QuerydslPredicateExecutor` to execute queries.
- Build queries using `Querydsl`'s generated `Q-classes`.

### 2.4 Custom Query Logic in Service Layer

- **When to use**: For more complex use cases not easily addressed by *JpaSpecificationExecutor* or **Querydsl**.
- **How it works**: Manually build **CriteriaQuery** in the service layer, adding dyanmic predicates based on
  conditions.

#### Solution:

- Create a dynamic `CriteriaBuilder` query based on input criteria.
- Combine different predicates for each condition.

## Summary

- **JpaSpecificationExecutor**: Best for simple dynamic filtering using multiple conditions.
- **@Querydsl with Dynamic Parameters**: Quick solution for simple dynamic queries.
- **Querydsl**: Advanced option for complex and type-safe queries.
- **Custom Criteria Queries**: For highly customized dynamic queries with specific needs.
